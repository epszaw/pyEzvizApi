### Fixed

- Fixed direct-local SDK CAS bootstrapping for HP7/CP7-style devices by adding
  app-style P2P session registration before local-sdk CAS lookups, with opt-out
  switches for diagnostics and normal retry-limit handling for refreshed
  sessions.
- Fixed direct-local SDK CAS lookups against EZVIZ CAS endpoints that present
  expired public TLS certificates by tolerating WebPKI expiry for the CAS socket
  only after normal TLS verification fails specifically for expiry, while still
  requiring the expired peer certificate to match the CAS hostname.
- Fixed CAS cloud request compatibility with the Android app by defaulting CAS
  XML requests to `ClientType=3`, exposing an explicit `EzvizCAS` client type
  override, and reading complete framed CAS socket responses instead of relying
  on a single partial `recv()`.
- Fixed malformed MQTT payloads stopping the complete push client; invalid,
  non-object, non-UTF-8, and oversized messages are now discarded while the
  listener remains active.
- Fixed MQTT registration/start/stop error handling so connection failures are
  reported at the network request boundary instead of during response decoding.
- Fixed MQTT lifecycle cleanup so duplicate starts cannot orphan a Paho loop,
  failed remote deregistration remains retryable, and conflicting cached TLS or
  filtering options are rejected instead of silently ignored.

- Fixed the DVR config sidecar to exit nonzero on failed `NET_DVR_GetDVRConfig` reads before emitting output buffers.

## v1.0.5.0 - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Added direct-local SDK streaming support for cached local-SDK credentials, including CAS probing, stream bootstrap, and FFmpeg remuxing for local live-view captures.
- Added local IDMX HEVC stream handling for encrypted EZVIZ local payloads, converting media-wrapper frames to Annex B and decrypting encrypted HEVC NAL prefixes for `--decrypt-video` captures.
- Added an HCNetSDK command-port multi-socket plan backend for native-style port-8000 flows that open short control sockets before the media socket.
- Added native-Python HCNetSDK command-port login frame generation, RSA challenge decoding, login proof generation, and login-session parsing with the follow-up command auth seed.
- Added native-Python HCNetSDK command-port auth word generation, complete `0x63` control-frame generation, and reusable control-template extraction for post-login port-8000 commands.
- Added generated HCNetSDK command-port multi-socket save support, including fresh login, session-relative plan rendering, and CLI JSON loading via `--hcnetsdk-command-generated-plan-file`.
- Added built-in `app-lan-live-view` HCNetSDK command-port native-plan support for channel 1, exposed through `hcnetsdk_command_port_native_lan_live_view_plan()` and `--hcnetsdk-command-native-plan app-lan-live-view`, so app-observed LAN preview captures no longer require a separate generated-plan JSON file.
- Added a generated-plan `body_tail_transform=play_login_today` option for refreshing captured native `0x111040` play-login date words during live command-port rendering.
- Added offline `stream hcnetsdk-command-plan-generate` support to convert concrete port-8000 socket plan JSON into reusable generated-plan JSON.
- Added sanitized command-port exchange metadata, bounded command-body tail word samples, media-socket keepalive timing, sampled packet timings/hashes, and bounded IDMX/H.264 frame-shape summaries with RTP-like sequence/timestamp continuity to local stream metadata output and `save clip --hcnetsdk-command-metadata-output` for generated-plan diagnostics.
- Added sanitized H.264 Annex-B NAL-unit and IDR-window summarizers, plus an offline `stream h264-annexb-summary` CLI, for comparing native player dumps with generated command-port diagnostics without storing media contents.
- Added offline `stream hcnetsdk-command-dump-summary` support for summarizing Frida command-frame, inbound-media, and PlayM4 input dump artifacts without printing frame bodies or credentials.
- Added optional IDR-window FFmpeg decode checks to `stream hcnetsdk-command-dump-summary` so native command-port dumps can show startup corruption and later clean windows directly.
- Added `tools/apk-re/bin/hcnetsdk-command-live-check`, an owner-run port-8000 compatibility matrix runner that loads ignored inventory secrets, runs the built-in native LAN live-view plan, validates MPEG-TS output with FFprobe, and writes per-camera verdicts without exposing passwords, serials, or encryption keys.
- Added `EZVIZ_FRIDA_WITH_STREAM_TRANSFORM=1` support to the command-shape Frida runner so command-port and PlayM4 input artifacts can be captured in one native session.
- Added `EZVIZ_HCNETSDK_FORCE_PREVIEW_AFTER_LOGIN=1` for Frida command-shape diagnostics that need to route a LAN login into the native preview activity.
- Added Frida command-shape runner env injection for target and dump settings, and fixed TCP-shape fingerprint logging on Frida runtimes without `Uint8Array.slice()`.
- Added an experimental `read_first_media_immediately` command-plan flag for HCNetSDK startup-order diagnostics.
- Added an experimental `delay_after_commands_seconds` command-plan field for matching native HCNetSDK command-port startup pacing during diagnostics.
- Added an experimental `keepalive_initial_delay_seconds` command-plan field for matching native HCNetSDK media-socket keepalive pacing during diagnostics.
- Added `--hcnetsdk-h264-skip-initial-idr-windows` to drop corrupt startup IDR windows before remuxing clear H.264 IDMX command-port captures.
- Added `--hcnetsdk-h264-trim-to-clean-idr-window` to decode-check sampled startup IDR windows and remux clear H.264 IDMX command-port captures from the first clean window.
- Added `--hcnetsdk-h264-clean-idr-preroll-seconds` to overcapture before clean-IDR trimming so generated command-port clips can keep more requested clean duration after startup corruption is discarded.
- Added `--hcnetsdk-h264-clean-idr-max-windows` to raise the clean-IDR decode-check search limit for long unstable command-port startups.
- Added `--hcnetsdk-h264-wait-for-clean-idr-window` and `--hcnetsdk-h264-clean-idr-wait-seconds` to discard corrupt H.264 IDMX startup media before starting the requested capture duration.
- Added generic `--hcnetsdk-video-*` clean-window aliases so H.264 and HEVC command-port captures can use the same recovery options.
- Added regression coverage for RTP dump decryption when `--decrypt-video` is used with explicit encrypted-header codec modes.

### Changed

- Refreshed CAS service metadata only for CLI CAS flows and preserved cached-session reuse behind stricter `sysConf` checks.
- Updated RTP stream dumping so user-selected decrypt-codec modes control the decrypt offset while transport detection still drives RTP depacketizing and remuxing.
- Bumped `requests` from 2.33.1 to 2.34.2.

### Fixed

- Fixed cloud and direct-local stream timeout handling so unreachable/offline cameras raise clear `DeviceException` errors instead of leaking raw timeouts.
- Fixed direct-local encrypted-header decryption to preserve PES boundaries and avoid H.264/HEVC RTP payload overlap during stream remuxing.
- Fixed HCNetSDK command-port media framing by parsing port-8000 `$` length words as little-endian total frame lengths, and added clear H.264 IDMX remuxing for those media packets.
- Fixed generated HCNetSDK command-port `0x63` control bodies to serialize the login session id in native network order, matching auth-word generation and avoiding no-body `0x1e` responses.
- Fixed bounded local-stream capture duration accounting so generated-login/bootstrap latency does not reduce the requested media capture window.
- Fixed HCNetSDK command-port response reads to tolerate native short no-body ack headers used during play-login draining.
- Documented and regression-tested the stable generated HCNetSDK media-step shape: plan JSON media sockets default to leaving the native `0x30000` IMKH reply on the media socket as prefix data instead of consuming it as a control response.
- Fixed clear H.264 IDMX extraction to require the native RTP payload type 96 before treating IDMX bodies as H.264 NAL/FU-A media, leaving 104/112 startup prelude records out of the Annex-B remux even when their bytes look video-shaped.
- Documented the practical generated-plan capture recipe for warning-free native-style command-port H.264 remuxes: preserve the media-prefix behavior, refresh play-login date words, and skip the first startup IDR window.
- Fixed Frida command-shape TCP fingerprint helpers to avoid global-name collisions when the stream-transform hook is loaded in the same session.
- Improved HCNetSDK command-port multi-socket errors with socket-step, frame, command id, and first-media context.
- Preserved partial HCNetSDK command-port bootstrap metadata when the media socket resets before the first packet.
- Fixed partial CAS probe writes and base64 local-SDK CAS key handling.
- Fixed HCNetSDK command-port HEVC remuxing by preserving IDMX packet boundaries, handling direct/RTP/HRUDP media wrappers, carrying HEVC parameter sets into clean IRAP probes, and remuxing raw HEVC with an explicit input rate.
- Fixed `ptz_control_coordinates()` to use the app-matched `PTZManualCtrl/CtrlPTZ3DPosition` IoT action endpoint with `positionPoint.x/y`, restoring y-axis tilt coordinate moves.
- Fixed PTZ coordinate validation to reject negative coordinate values and omitted zoom hints from point moves so focus/zoom metadata is left unchanged.

## v1.0.4.9 - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Added cloud stream bootstrap helpers for VTM pagelist metadata, VTDU token retrieval, VTM/VTDU packet framing, `ysproto` URL handling, limited stream protobuf parsing, RTP payload extraction, and transport detection.
- Added VTM server public-key extraction plus native VTDU protobuf helpers for `GetVtduInfo`, `StartStream`, `PeerStream`, and `StopStream` stream-control messages.
- Added a sanitized VTM trace harness and CLI command for live stream diagnostics without exposing packet bodies, tokens, or keys.
- Added experimental VTM stream dump/proxy CLI commands and README usage for writing VLC-friendly one-minute MPEG-TS captures by default, raw payload dumps on request, or serving a local FFmpeg-remuxed MPEG-TS URL.
- Added Hikvision/EZVIZ MPEG-PS video payload decryption for `stream dump --decrypt-video` and `stream proxy --decrypt-video`, covering battery-camera streams that keep the VTM channel clear but encrypt HEVC/H.264 NAL bodies.
- Added cloud video list/detail client helpers plus `cloud_videos` and `cloud_video_download` CLI commands for exploring and saving EZVIZ cloud clip media when the API returns a direct HTTP(S) URL.
- Added `get_camera_ticket_info()` for the `/v3/cameras/ticketInfo` ticket used by the native cloud-storage download path.
- Added pure-Python cloud `.tmp` PS/NAL decryption through `cloud_video_decrypt`.
- Added pure-Python EZVIZ cloud replay download support for regular cloud-storage `streamUrl` clips, so `cloud_video_download` can fetch encrypted `.tmp` bytes without Android tooling and decrypt them locally.
- Added SD-card playback record helpers plus the `sdcard_videos` CLI for probing the EZVIZ app's v2/common/intelligent record-list endpoints.
- Added alarm image download/decrypt helper support for EZVIZ/Hik encrypted snapshot payloads.

### Changed

- Updated CI, CodeQL, and Dependency Review pull-request path filters so tests-only changes trigger the required checks, and excluded the captured pagelist fixture from Codespell because it preserves upstream cloud/device strings verbatim.

### Fixed

- Fixed VTM tracing to parse delayed `StreamInfoRsp` packets after earlier control packets so redirects are still followed.
- Fixed encrypted alarm image detection to search the full payload for the encryption marker before deciding whether to decrypt.
- Fixed VTDU token lookup when EZVIZ service URLs return a null `authAddr` by deriving the auth host from `api_url`.
- Fixed `--decrypt-codec h264` to remain the backwards-compatible clear-header H.264 mode, with `h264-encrypted-header` for H.264 streams whose NAL header is encrypted.

## v1.0.4.8 - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Added sanitized full pagelist fixture coverage for `get_device_infos()` and `load_devices(refresh=False)` so the parser is tested against a realistic cloud response without live EZVIZ credentials.

### Changed

- Updated remote unlock to prefer terminal-derived bind codes from the EZVIZ terminals API while preserving legacy bind-code fallback behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed `set_floodlight_brightness()` to accept `luminance=100`, matching the documented 1-100 range and allowing Home Assistant brightness sliders to reach full brightness/color night-vision mode.

## v1.0.4.7 - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Added manual release dispatch to the trusted PyPI publish workflow so releases can be published by running a workflow with the requested version.
- Added `codespell`, `pip-audit`, and Pyright checks to CI for extra spelling, dependency vulnerability, and static typing coverage.

### Changed

- Widened camera key/auth verification-code argument typing to accept string codes from Home Assistant forms without forcing callers to cast.
- Reworked device wrapper construction through a dedicated factory to remove client/device module import cycles while preserving existing wrapper behavior.
- Lazy-load top-level `pyezvizapi` package exports to reduce eager import graph pressure while keeping convenient imports such as `from pyezvizapi import EzvizClient`.
- Tightened `EzvizClient` JSON payload typing with a shared `JsonDict` alias and fixed Pyright-reported optional-token and MQTT-client typing issues.
- Updated release automation so the prepare step opens a changelog PR and the publish step validates, builds, smoke-tests, uploads to PyPI, and creates the GitHub release.

### Removed

- Removed the superseded manual-release workflow in favor of the trusted PyPI publish workflow dispatch path.

## v1.0.4.6 - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Modern package build checks in CI, including wheel install, CLI smoke tests, and supported Python version matrix coverage.
- Offline tests for utility helpers, feature parsing, device parsing, MQTT decoding, pagelist pagination, HTTP helpers, auth/token lifecycle behavior, camera/light/smart-plug status helpers, alarm parsing, CLI command dispatch, load-device aggregation, unified-message request building, device add/security flows, devconfig/network helpers, IoT feature/action helpers, device maintenance/admin helpers, voice/whistle/chime helpers, PTZ/panoramic helpers, camera key/2FA flows, managed-device/status/P2P helpers, time-plan/search helpers, lower-tail client helpers, CAS helpers, RTSP helpers, and MQTT demo tooling.
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker so downstream type checkers can consume inline package types.
- Example wrappers for MQTT listening and RTSP authentication testing.

### Changed

- Added CI coverage reporting, coverage XML artifacts, and a conservative 85% coverage floor.
- Added CI `pip check` validation for both editable development installs and built-wheel smoke-test installs.
- Added release workflow wheel smoke testing with `pip check` and CLI help checks before PyPI publishing.
- Added a manual release-check workflow for dry-run package builds, optional tag/version verification, wheel smoke testing, and artifact upload before publishing.
- Added CodeQL security-and-quality scanning for Python on relevant pull requests, pushes, scheduled runs, and manual dispatch.
- Added Dependency Review checks for dependency and workflow changes, failing high-severity vulnerable dependency updates before merge.
- Documented the development validation workflow, artifact cleanup commands, and offline-test policy in the README.
- Added contributor, support, security, PR checklist, and issue-template documentation for safer reports and easier maintenance.
- Added editor and Git line-ending defaults, plus Ruff cache ignores, to reduce generated-artifact and formatting drift.
- Added package metadata links for documentation and changelog discoverability on PyPI.
- Added Home Assistant integration contract documentation for stable APIs, status payloads, auth exceptions, MQTT behavior, and release coordination.
- Limited alarm prefetching to camera devices so smart-plug/socket serials are not queried as camera alarm targets.
- Added PyPI keywords and Trove classifiers for supported Python versions, typed-package status, Home Assistant/EZVIZ discovery, and CLI/library usage.
- Consolidated package metadata into `pyproject.toml` while keeping `setup.py` as a compatibility shim.
- Restored the installed `pyezvizapi` console script via `project.scripts`.
- Replaced CLI table rendering dependency on pandas with a small stdlib formatter.

### Removed

- Removed pandas from the runtime dependency set.

## Release checklist

Before publishing a release:

1. Bump `project.version` in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Move relevant entries from `Unreleased` to a dated version section by running **Prepare Release** with the bare version and merging the generated changelog PR.
3. Ensure CI is green on `main`.
4. Run **Upload Python Package** manually with the same bare version.
5. Confirm the workflow publishes to PyPI and creates the matching GitHub release/tag.
